## Building a Sales Analytics API

You are tasked with building a RESTful API for sales analytics using MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.js. The API should provide various endpoints to analyze sales data stored in a MongoDB database.

### Requirements:

- Create a MongoDB database with a collection named `sales`. Each document in the collection should have the following structure:

```
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "product": "Product Name",
  "quantity": 5,
  "price": 10,
  "date": ISODate("2023-09-01T00:00:00Z")
}
```

- Create a Mongoose model for the sales collection.

- Build the following API endpoints:

  - `GET /api/sales/total-revenue`: Calculate and return the total revenue generated by all sales transactions.

  - `GET /api/sales/quantity-by-product`: Find and return the total quantity sold for each product.

  - `GET /api/sales/top-products`: Retrieve the top 5 products with the highest total revenue, along with their total revenue values.

  - `GET /api/sales/average-price`: Calculate and return the average price of products sold.

  - `GET /api/sales/revenue-by-month`: Group the sales data by month and year and calculate the total revenue for each month-year combination.

  - `GET /api/sales/highest-quantity-sold`: Find and return the product that had the highest quantity sold on a single day.

  - `GET /api/sales/department-salary-expense`: Calculate and return the total salary expense for each department.

- Use Express.js to create a server that listens on a specified port.

- Use MongoDB aggregation framework to perform complex data aggregation tasks for the API endpoints.

- Test the API using Postman to ensure that it works correctly.

### Submission Instruction:

- Document the API endpoints using postman and include in the repository.

- Please submit your GitHub repository link.
